# Emitigen
Emitigen is a program that fetches data from NISD ASD, calculates a frequency for each wavelength band, and scales the frequencies of the wavelengths of each element's visible light emission spectrum to the audible sound spectrum, thus allowing you to "hear" an element's light emission. The elements don't actually produce these noises, but this functions as one way to perceive the data from a different perspective. The tones and spectrums of each element is made visible when you click on an item on the periodic table.

Fetching the data and exporting it into the sound and color is done in python
UI done in javascript
